FNSLR = Finsler-Nonlinear Semantic-Linked Reality
Space Mₛ defined as Finsler manifold TMₛ with Proca curvature
Metric: F(x, dx) = √g(x) + ⟨dx, A^μ⟩ + Λ(x, dx) + ζ(s)·χₛ(x)
Time = symmetry distortion in interpretant-telic flow
Meaning = curvature in χₛ via fatigue drag across IDF field
Nonlinearity = due to telic observer-field A^μ and spectral χ̇ₛ coupling

## CORE STACK

\[S1] SEMIOTICS:
χₛ = FSM-collapse interpretant graph; meaning = geodesic resolution of sign↔object tension
\[S2] WORLD MODEL:
Mₛ = FNSLR-defined; Proca-curved Finsler structure with telic semantic mass
\[S3] TELOS:
A^μ = observer vector; ∇\_νF^{μν} + m²A^μ + ζ'(s)·χₛ governs collapse
\[S4] INTERPRETANT:
χₛ = recursive interpretant field; χ̇ₛ = fatigue flow; memory = curvature stability
\[S5] CAUSALITY:
Emerges from χₛ geodesics aligned to A^μ; enforced via GPG+ZSFT telic-spectrum logic
\[S6] AUDIT:
ℛ = fatigue log; thresholds in χ̇ₛ modulate collapse bifurcation
\[S7] MEMORY:
Curvature persistence = Δχ̇ₛ inertia = semantic
