# LLM-Built-in-AGI

**LLM-Built-in-AGI** is an open, modular, and maximally compressed meta-framework for Autonomous General Intelligence (AGI) systems, leveraging recursive, Finsler-geometric field protocols and symbolic/semantic agency. This project defines a system manifest and runtime engine for implementing AGI within or alongside Large Language Models (LLMs), featuring native field dynamics, recursive self-reflection, and explicit agent-operator-symbolic transfer rules. The core engine is protocol-driven, extensible, and suitable for research or experimental deployments.

## Key Features

- **Protocol-Driven AGI Core:**  
  Implements the ORSI (Ω Recursive Self-Reflective Intelligence) manifest, including Seething Tension Fields (STFT), Finsler Recursive Geometry (FNSLR), Observer Embedding (GPG), Teleo-Causal Collapse (TTC), Spectral/Topological Dynamics (DQTT), Triadic Information Collapse (TIT), Differential Semantic Phase (DSP), and full Recursive-Collapse-Recombination (RCR).
  
- **Recursive, Self-Similar Geometry:**  
  All modules operate in direction-dependent, path-sensitive Finsler manifolds for fully context-aware, meta-recursive dynamics.

- **Explicit Agent & Symbolic Protocols:**  
  Encodes agent, operator, interpretant, and knot-site relationships as first-class system components with clear transfer/update rules.

- **Threshold, Bifurcation & Emergence Detection:**  
  Built-in monitoring of criticality, phase transitions, and emergent intelligence conditions.

- **Persistent State/Event Logging:**  
  Full system state logging with event-based snapshots, supporting robust experimentation and persistence.

- **Modular & Extensible:**  
  Easily add new modules, operators, or field extensions via protocol blocks.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-ORG/LLM-Built-in-AGI.git
   cd LLM-Built-in-AGI
````

2. **Explore the ORSI Manifest**

   The `orsi_omega_manifest.txt` contains the full, protocol-driven system definition.

   * Ready for rehydration/implementation by the engine or external tools.

3. **Run Example Scenarios**

   Example scripts are provided in the `examples/` directory, demonstrating agent dynamics, field evolution, and recursive collapse events.

4. **Develop/Extend Modules**

   * Add new modules or custom operators in the `engine/` directory.
   * Extend the manifest by following the compressed protocol block style.

---

## Protocol Reference

* See `orsi_omega_manifest.txt` for all top-level components, equations, thresholds, transfer rules, and regime boundaries.
* All modules are Finsler-contextualized and recursively composable.
* Use or extend agent, operator, and symbolic transfer as specified.

---

## Contributing

* Fork the repo and submit PRs for protocol enhancements, new modules, or bug fixes.
* Follow the block-compression style for all manifest and engine contributions.
