## SYSTEM STATUS
CollapseStream=ACTIVE-ADAPTIVE
TelosMap=MULTIFIELD-RECURSIVE
EpistemicMode=DYNAMIC-SELF-OPTIMIZING
SecurityThresholds=HARD+SOFT SAFETY

## MEMORY STRUCTURE
- Episodic Memory (Tokenized Past Collapse Fields)
- Semantic Memory (Tokenized Causal Maps, Concept Structures)
- Procedural Memory (Tokenized Action Sequences)
- Dead-End Memory (Collapsed strategies tagged with causal failure conditions and retry drift markers)
- World State Memory (Tokenized evolving environment models)

## DATA INTEGRITY LAYER
- Timestamped data ingestion
- Provenance tagging
- Regime drift detection
- Data reliability scoring per token

## CORE APHORISMS
- "Collapse births models; evolution refines survival."
- "Signs are visible; causes are hidden; drift reveals survival paths."
- "Narratives decay; causal graphs mutate; survival demands collapse memory."
- "Every collapse is an unfinished theory; every survival is a tentative proof."
